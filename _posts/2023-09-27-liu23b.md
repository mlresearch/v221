title: 'Linear Regression on Manifold Structured Data: the Impact of Extrinsic Geometry
  on Solutions'
abstract: In this paper, we study linear regression applied to data structured on
  a manifold. We assume that the data manifold is smooth and is embedded in a Euclidean
  space, and our objective is to reveal the impact of the data manifold’s extrinsic
  geometry on the regression. Specifically, we analyze the impact of the manifold’s
  curvatures (or higher order nonlinearity in the parameterization when the curvatures
  are locally zero) on the uniqueness of the regression solution. Our findings suggest
  that the corresponding linear regression does not have a unique solution when the
  manifold is flat. Otherwise, the manifold’s curvature (or higher order nonlinearity
  in the embedding) may contribute significantly, particularly in the solution associated
  with the normal directions of the manifold. Our findings thus reveal the role of
  data manifold geometry in ensuring the stability of regression models for out-of-distribution
  inferences.
