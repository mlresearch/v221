title: ReLU Neural Networks, Polyhedral Decompositions, and Persistent Homology
abstract: A ReLU neural network leads to a finite polyhedral decomposition of input
  space and a corresponding finite dual graph. We show that while this dual graph
  is a coarse quantization of input space, it is sufficiently robust that it can be
  combined with persistent homology to detect homological signals of manifolds in
  the input space from  samples. This property holds for a wide range of networks
  trained for a wide range of purposes that have nothing to do with this topological
  application. We found this feature to be surprising and interesting; we hope it
  will also be useful.
